 <h2> About Me </h2>
     
     
<p>Attending <strong>United Tribes Technical University</strong>.
<br>Currently finishing up my associate's degree in Environmental Science and Research<br> (Second year, second semester)</p>
<p>I was born and raised in ND, most of my family lives in Flasher, ND.<br>
My plan is to get my bachelor's degree in Environmental Science and Research and then move towards the west coast with my fiance! </p> 
<p> I'm excited to join the ESIIL team! I've had an interest in coding since I took a highschool intro to coding class. I don't remember which coding language we focused on, but I'm ready to start learning Python and seeing how it can help data collection and storage!
